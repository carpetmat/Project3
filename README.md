Project 3: Plate Tectonics Report<br>
<br>
<p>
For this project our task was to plot earthquake data downloaded from the USGS Earthquake catalog. The earthquakes to be included in the dataset will cover the region around the Juan De Fuca plate specifically, with magnitudes of 2.5 or higher.
</p>
<p>
For this report I will be doing the following:
</p>
1. Plot earthquake magnitude vs time on a scatter plot.<br>

2. Show earthquake locations and magnitudes on a map. I will use both color and radius of a circle to reflect the relative magnitudes:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interactive crossfiltered map of the data can be found here: <a href="https://carpetmat.github.io/Project3/CrossFilter.html" target="_blank">Link</a><br>
<br>
3. Answer these questions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Across what geographic area are you able to observe earthquake data in this map?<br><br>
<br><p>This geological area is over the western edge of the united states, in which there are several known plate boundaries.</p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Why do you see most of the earthquakes in that area?<br>
<br><p>Several plates meet around the Juan De Fuca plate and all three types of plate boundaries exist in this area.</p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• What is the range of earthquake size (magnitude) in this data?<br>
<br><p>Magnitudes 2.5 to 6.8.</p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• What is the average earthquake size in this area?<br>
<br><p>The average earthquake magnitude is: 3.2. Though this is heavily influenced by our data limits.</p><br>
4. Map the earthquakes in April 2015. Where are those earthquakes mostly located?<br>
<img width="50%" height="50%" alt="Did it work?" src=Images/2015_04.PNG>
<br><p>There are a large number of relatively high magnitude earthquakes in in April of 2015. All taking place along the divergent boundary between the Jaun De Fuca and Pacific plates.</p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• What event can you link these earthquakes to?<br>
5. Identify a divergent boundary and a transform boundary on the map and answer this question:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• What kind of patterns in earthquake magnitude and location you observe over time along each boundary?<br>
