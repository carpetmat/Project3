Project 3: Plate Tectonics Report<br>
<br>
<p>
For this project our task was to plot earthquake data downloaded from the USGS Earthquake catalog. The earthquakes to be included in the dataset will cover the region around the Juan De Fuca plate specifically, with magnitudes of 2.5 or higher.
</p>
<p>
For this report I will be doing the following:
</p>
<b>1. Plot earthquake magnitude vs time on a scatter plot.</b><br>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th><img width="150%" height="50%" alt="Aug 24th?" src=Images/fig1.PNG><br></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 1.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<b>2. Show earthquake locations and magnitudes on a map. I will use both color and radius of a circle to reflect the relative magnitudes:</b><br>
<br>
An Interactive map of the data can be found here: <a href="https://carpetmat.github.io/Project3/TimedGeojson.html" target="_blank">Link</a><br>
An heat map of the data can be found here: <a href="https://carpetmat.github.io/Project3/Heatmap.html" target="_blank">Link</a><br>
An interactive crossfiltered map of the data can be found here: <a href="https://carpetmat.github.io/Project3/CrossFilter.html" target="_blank">Link</a><br>
<br>
<b>3. Answer these questions:</b><br>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Across what geographic area are you able to observe earthquake data in this map?</b><br><br>

<br><p>This geological area is over the western edge of the united states, in which there are several known plate boundaries.</p><br>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Why do you see most of the earthquakes in that area?</b><br>

<br><p>Several plates meet around the Juan De Fuca plate and all three types of plate boundaries exist in this area.</p><br>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• What is the range of earthquake size (magnitude) in this data?</b><br>

<br><p>Magnitudes 2.5 to 6.8.</p><br>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• What is the average earthquake size in this area?</b><br>

<br><p>The average earthquake magnitude is: 3.2. Though this is heavily influenced by our data limits.</p><br>

<b>4. Map the earthquakes in April 2015. Where are those earthquakes mostly located?</b><br>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th><img width="50%" height="50%" alt="Aug 24th?" src=Images/fig2.PNG><br></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 2.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br><p>As seen above in figure 2, there are a large number of relatively high magnitude earthquakes in in April of 2015. All taking place along the divergent boundary between the Jaun De Fuca and Pacific plates.</p><br>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• What event can you link these earthquakes to?</b><br>

<br><p>These earthquakes are likely linked to the erruption of the Axial Seamount Volcano [1]. Which can be seen as a pin point on the map in figure 2. Interestingly the erruption was not caused by a earthquake near the volcano, but a distance away, along the plate boundary it sits on top of.</p><br>

<b>5. Identify a divergent boundary and a transform boundary on the map and answer this question:</b><br>

<br><p> Platenames and plate boundaries are identified by mousing over the boundaries in the interactive map. Please note the crossfilter interactive map does not have this feature. Plate names are disabled by default, but can be enabled via the maps layer controls in the top right corner.</p><br>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• What kind of patterns in earthquake magnitude and location you observe over time along each boundary?</b><br>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th><img width="60%" height="25%" alt="Aug 24th?" src=Images/fig3.PNG><br></th>
    <th><img width="60%" height="25%" alt="Aug 24th?" src=Images/fig4.PNG><br></th>
    <th><img width="60%" height="25%" alt="Aug 24th?" src=Images/fig5.PNG><br></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 3.</td>
    <td>Figure 4.</td>
    <td>Figure 5.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
